# Data-Wrangling-of-WeRateDogs-twitter-account
This project is about Data Wrangling, part of the data analysis nano-degree from Udacity.

It will analyse the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
There are two parts in the project:
1- Data wrangling, which include gathering, assessment, and cleaning the gathered data, and then store it in one master file.
2- The clean gathered data in the master file will be used for the purpose of analysis and visualization.
